# Example PrimaCMS Page

This is a sample page created in the PrimaCMS pages directory.

## Purpose

This demonstrates how PrimaCMS pages work alongside the existing static `.astro` pages in the `src/pages/` directory.

## Access

This page is accessible at `/example-page`

## Content Management

You can add more pages by creating new markdown files in `src/content/primacms-pages/` with the required frontmatter fields:

- `title`: The page title
- `description`: A brief description of the page

The content will be automatically rendered using the page template.
