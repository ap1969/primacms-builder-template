We're thrilled to announce a major update to our collaboration features, designed to help teams work together more effectively and efficiently.

## Real-time Collaboration

Our enhanced collaboration tools now include:

- Real-time document editing with multiple users
- Presence indicators showing who's currently viewing or editing
- Inline commenting and @mentions for targeted feedback
- Version history with the ability to restore previous versions
- Change tracking to see who made specific edits

### Pro Tip

Use the new "Focus Mode" when you need uninterrupted work time. This will temporarily pause notifications while still recording all comments and changes for you to review later.

## Team Spaces

We've introduced Team Spaces to help organize your collaborative work:

- Dedicated workspaces for different teams or projects
- Customizable permissions and access controls
- Team-specific dashboards showing relevant metrics and tasks
- Shared calendars for coordinating schedules and deadlines
- Team announcement boards for important updates

## Enhanced Communication Tools

Communication is at the heart of collaboration, so we've significantly improved our messaging capabilities:

- Threaded conversations for organized discussions
- Rich text formatting with support for code snippets
- Integrated video conferencing for quick meetings
- Screen sharing capabilities for demonstrations
- Message scheduling for non-disruptive communication
- Improved search functionality to find past conversations

## Task Management Improvements

We've also enhanced our task management capabilities to better support collaborative work:

- Team task boards with customizable workflows
- Dependency tracking between related tasks
- Workload balancing tools to prevent team burnout
- Time tracking integration for better project management
- Automated progress reports for stakeholders

These new collaboration features are available to all customers on Business and Enterprise plans, with limited functionality available on the Professional plan.

We're excited to see how these tools help your team work more effectively together. As always, we welcome your feedback as you explore these new capabilities.
