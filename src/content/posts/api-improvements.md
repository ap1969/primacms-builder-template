We're excited to announce significant improvements to our API along with new endpoints to help developers build more powerful integrations with our platform.

## API Version 2.0

Our new API version 2.0 includes several major improvements:

- RESTful design principles for more intuitive resource access
- Improved rate limits with better handling for high-volume requests
- Comprehensive error messages with actionable suggestions
- OAuth 2.0 implementation for more secure authentication
- Pagination for all list endpoints to improve performance

## New Endpoints

We've added several new endpoints to enable more advanced integrations:

- **/analytics** - Access detailed analytics data for your account
- **/webhooks** - Configure and manage webhook notifications
- **/automations** - Create and manage automated workflows
- **/teams** - Manage team members and permissions
- **/files** - Upload, download, and manage files

## Improved Documentation

Along with these API improvements, we've completely revamped our developer documentation:

- Interactive API explorer for testing endpoints directly in the browser
- Code examples in multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go)
- Step-by-step integration guides for common use cases
- Comprehensive reference documentation for all endpoints
- Changelog to track API updates and changes

### Migration Guide

We've prepared a comprehensive migration guide to help you transition from API v1 to v2. The guide includes detailed information on breaking changes, new features, and best practices for updating your integrations.

## Deprecation Schedule

To ensure a smooth transition, we'll be supporting API v1 alongside v2 according to this schedule:

- **Now - October 2025:** Both API v1 and v2 available
- **October 2025:** API v1 enters maintenance mode (no new features)
- **April 2026:** API v1 deprecated (still functional but with warnings)
- **October 2026:** API v1 sunset (no longer available)

We recommend migrating to API v2 as soon as possible to take advantage of the new features and improvements.

If you have any questions or need assistance with the migration, please don't hesitate to reach out to our developer support team.
